        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>Hello, my name is (name), I am from (location). I've been a programming, web developing and coding student for
            8 months, and for me, programming is not something that you should learn about, it's a hobby, which is something that I openly enjoy.
            I am always open to new knowledge about programming and to apply them in practice, and to learn about the basics behind many coding
            programs.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Skills:</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript<br>
            <strong>Programming Tools:</strong> IntelliJ, Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
        </p>
